34. Rule34 is life

## Workflow
1. Tell team which section you are working on the file. (To avoid edit overlap.)
	Viewing & Running the files is fine. Only need to say when you're editing.
2. Pull before you edit.
3. Make edits on the part you specified.
4. If you are editing a long time, [save, pull, commit, push] once every large chunk.
5. Don't forget to [save, pull, commit, push] once you finished.
